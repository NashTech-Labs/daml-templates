# Hostel Mangement System

The objective of the Proposed System is to improve Hostel Services provided by 3rd Party Service Provider by using the Immutable Smart Contracts. 
     Before transferring money to Service Provider, Manager initiates Confirmation-Contact with hostlers as a party to know their feedback. If everyone approves only then Manager can initiate Money-Transfer Contract with Service Provider.
